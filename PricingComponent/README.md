# PricingComponent

## About

My training resolution for the [Interactive pricing component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-pricing-component-t0m8PIyY8) problem from the [FrontEnd Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/ ). To create this application, SCSS, JavaScript and HTML were used. For a better adaptation to the different mobile first screens it was implemented.
